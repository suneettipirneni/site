# An unoriginal title for an unoriginal concept

I'm going to write stuff here that randomly comes to mind. This maybe stuff from javascript/typescript or other languages and tools I find interesting.

# ~~Why Astro~~

~~I've always been a fan of react, and traditionally when deploying a site I would choose something like next.js. In this case, however, I wanted something~~
~~more lightweight. With all the hype surrounding astro lately, I figured I didn't have much to lose.~~

~~In addition, astro seems to have a great api to deal with md(x) files. I'm a big fan of markdown, and I'm hoping to use it as much as possible.~~

~~In case you were wondering, I didn't make this site from scratch. It's based on the AstroPaper template. In the future I'm planning to extend it to my liking.~~

# Just Kidding! I'm using Next.js now!

I've decided to switch to Next.js. With it's recent changes for react server components, and the `/app` directory, I think it's a great choice for a blog. I'm also a big fan of the Vercel platform, so it's a win-win.

I'm using the following other packages

- [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/): To make it easier to work with mdx files for my blog posts.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): To make it easier to style my site.
- [rehype](https://unifiedjs.com/): To allow me to easily parse and modify the html generated by mdx files.
- [Delba de Oliveira's Blog](https://delba.dev/): As a reference for how to use contentlayer and design various blog elements.
