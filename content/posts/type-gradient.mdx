# Early Exposure to Static Types

My first programming language I learned (Java) was my first exposure to static types. At the time, I didn't really think much of them, I knew they were needed
to make things work but it never crossed my mind what their importance was. Their use was made more clear when I ventured into the domain of untyped languages
like Python. Coming from Java the terseness of Python felt like a breath of fresh air. I could write a lot less code and get the same result. It was great! However,
this honeymoon period was short lived. I had run into my first runtime error (that wasn't a `NullPointerException`). I read some data from the stdin and passed it into
a function expecting an `int`.

```python
current_year = 2014
age = input("Enter your age: ")

def calculate_year_born(age):
    return current_year - age

print(f"You were born in {calculate_year_born(age)}!")
```

I was then greeted with this error:

```txt title="error.txt"
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'str'
```

The error here was clear, I was trying to subtract a string from an integer. I had forgotten to convert the input to an integer.
This was a simple fix:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

# The Pendulum Swings

But as my code complexity and requirements grew, I ran into more of these errors. Soon it felt like I was coding blind,
there was no autocomplete for methods, no type hints, and no compiler to catch my mistakes.

I was spending more time debugging than writing code. The reasoning for Java making me put those funny names before every variable and function was becoming more clear.
Suddenly, the verbosity of Java felt like a small price to pay for the type safety it provided. The issue with loosely typed languages is more subtle, it's not that they
don't work, it's that they don't work well at scale. It's quite literally death by a thousand cuts. Each error is a cut to your productivity, and while each cut is small,
the combined effect is a much larger productivity laceration.

# A New Dimension of Static Types

At this point I had gained an appreciation for static types. However, because of my limited experience to other statically typed languages, I had assumed
that your language was either statically typed or it wasn't. There was no in-between, no gray areas, just a switch. It wasn't until much later it became clear
that not all statically typed languages are created equal.

When I first programmed in Swift, I learned about this new thing called "optionals". They we basically a way to tell a type system that a value may or may not be `nil`.
These were great, they exposed to something that was more statically typed than other statically-typed languages? Was this statically-typed++? I was intrigued.

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int?
}

let person = Person(name: "Suneet", age: nil)

print(person.age)
```

A nice compile time error popped up to let me know that I could be manipulating a value that may not exist.

```txt title="compile-error.txt"
error: value of optional type 'Int?' must be unwrapped to a value of type 'Int'
print(yearsAlive(age: person.age))
                             ^
```

Java would give me none of those errors I would have to wait until runtime to receive the dreaded `NullPointerException`.

This gave me a glimpse into the gradient of static typing and I was hooked. I wanted to make everything as statically typed as possible, there's no such thing as too much type safety right? So why
not go the very edge of the type spectrum?

# Static Types Overstay Their Welcome

## Too much Restriction

My initial assumptions of more static types being better was quickly challenged. This aversion didn't come from myself but from feedback other developers. While working on a library, we wanted a
a way to validate an arbitrary string was a valid [Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID). As such, we introduced the following TypeScript type:

```typescript
export type Snowflake = `${bigint}`;
```

We thought this was nice because of the validation it gave:

```typescript
// Compile Error: Type '"Invalid Snowflake"' is not assignable to type '`${bigint}`'.
const badId: Snowflake = "Invalid Snowflake";

// OK
const goodId: Snowflake = "12345";
```

When viewed in isolation this check seems harmless. However, in a more realistic codebase we are receiving stringified Snowflakes either from an external function or from another datasource such as a `.env`
or even a database. This brought a lot of inconveniences to developer since a cast was always needed to tell compiler a given string was a Snowflake.

For example, if we wanted to use a Snowflake from an environment variable we would have to do the following:

```typescript
const snowflakeFromEnv = process.env.SNOWFLAKE_ID as Snowflake;
```

Or if we wanted to use a Snowflake from a database we would have to do the following:

```typescript
const snowflakeFromDb = (await db.query(
	'SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = "Suneet"'
)) as Snowflake;
```

There's no compile time type in databases for a Snowflake, it's just treated as an arbitrary string. As a result this type change was reverted,
and we simply typed it as a plain ol' `string`.

## Documentation

Most (if not all) of the consumers of a library are using an IDE. Autocomplete is a godsend for developer productivity. And it allows developers to explore the API for a specific
symbol without having to leave their editor. Even better, if you use statically typed languages your users get this for free. However as the complexity of your types increases, so
does the amount of knowledge needed to understand them. In a language like TypeScript, the type system is quite robust. It's own type system is Turing complete, and just that feature
alone is enough to represent a multitude of type states.

Due to their complexity, these types initially were quite attractive to me. They allowed me to enable static types in more scenarios and even better, they removed a lot of type disambiguation
steps for the end users. However, this came at a cost. The cost was documentation. Rather than trying to explain this cost by way of words, I'll show you an example.

```typescript

```

## But my Safety!

This was one of the many examples of how static types can be too restrictive. But the fact a type system can be too restrictive was something completely new to me. I had never considering being "too correct" a
bad thing in the programming world.
