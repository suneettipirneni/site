# Problem Statement

Motion diffusions models (MDM) offer a way to translate text prompts into a set of joint frames corresponing to the prompt. In order to understand the core issue
with MDMs, we will first review how diffusion models operate, more specifically how diffusion models perform generation.

## Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a type of generative AI models, that aim to represent a multi-modal distribution of data. I won't delve into the learning process the models use but instead
I'll describe how the models perform generation. One of the faults of these models is that it assumes in the denoising step that noise is initially sampled from the normal distribution.
