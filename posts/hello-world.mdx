# An unoriginal title for an unoriginal concept

I'm going to write stuff here that randomly comes to mind. This maybe stuff from javascript/typescript or other languages and tools I find interesting.

# Why Astro

I've always been a fan of react, and traditionally when deploying a site I would choose something like next.js. In this case, however, I wanted something
more lightweight. With all the hype surrounding astro lately, I figured I didn't have much to lose.

In addition, astro seems to have a great api to deal with md(x) files. I'm a big fan of markdown, and I'm hoping to use it as much as possible.

In case you were wondering, I didn't make this site from scratch. It's based on the AstroPaper template. In the future I'm planning to extend it to my liking.
