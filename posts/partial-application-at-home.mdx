# What is partial application?

Partial application is a technique used in functional programming create a new function from an existing function where
specific arguments are set. A classic example of this is the `bind` function in JavaScript. The function returns a new function given a
the existing function and some arguments you would like to apply to it.

```js title="add.js"
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const addOne = add.bind(null, 1);

addOne(2); // 3
```

As shown above, `bind` creates a new reusable function from `add` where the first argument to `add` is always `1`.

# Why is this useful?

Partially applied functions improve the usability and portabilty of functional code. By providing predefined arguments to a function,
callers in other locations within your codebase have less arguments/dependencies to worry about. It also greatly simplifies function composition.
Without partial application, the example above would have to be written as:

```js title="add.js"
function addOne(b) {
  return add(1, b);
}
```

This has the same end result, but has more boilerplate.

# You've been using partial application this whole time

If you're not familiar with functional programming then you're most likely familiar with OOP concepts like objects. In rust and in
many other languages you can create objects(structs/classes) with constructors. A constructor is nothing more than a function to create
and instance of an object.

There's something special about these objects though, all of its instance methods have access to the instance-specific fields via an
implicity provided `self` parameter. I'll show you what I'm getting at by emulating partial application via rust structs.

```rust title="main.rs"
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  a + b
}

pub struct AddN(i32);

impl AddN {
  pub fn call(&self, b: i32) -> i32 {
    add(self.0, b)
  }
}

fn main() {
  let add_one = AddN(1);
  println!("{}", add_one.call(2)); // 3
}

```

This is a form of partial application. The constructor is the function that is partially applied
and the `self` parameter is the partially applied arguments. More specifically, our partially applied argument
is `self.0`. Whenever `add_one` is called we don't need to provide a `self` argument to `call`, further proving
this to be a roundabout way to do partial application.

Another approach would be to use a closure:

```rust title="main.rs"
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  a + b
}

fn main() {
  let add_one = |b: i32| add(1, b);
  println!("{}", add_one(2)); // 3
}
```

This is much more ergonomic than the struct approach.

Here's a spicy one using nightly rust:

```rust title="main.rs"
#![feature(unboxed_closures, fn_traits)]

fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    return x + y
}

struct AddOne;

impl FnMut<(i32,)> for AddOne {
    extern "rust-call" fn call_mut(
        &mut self,
        args: (i32,)
    ) -> i32 {
        return 24;
    }
}

impl FnOnce<(i32,)> for AddOne {
    type Output = i32;
    extern "rust-call" fn call_once(self, args: (i32,)) -> i32 {
        add(1, args.0)
    }
}

impl Fn<(i32,)> for AddOne {
    extern "rust-call" fn call(&self, args: (i32,)) -> i32 {
        add(1, args.0)
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", AddOne(3)) // 4
}
```

There's a good amount of redundancy, because `FnOnce` and `FnMut` need to be implemented in order to implement `Fn`. But it's kinda cool because unlike the vanilla rust
struct approach there's no indirection, you can call the struct as a function directly.

# So what's the point?

I think understanding how a feature can be _emulated_ in a language can help developers understand how it might be implemented under-the-hood.
And as a result give a better understanding of limitations and behaviours of the feature. If languages like rust or java ever implement partial application
it may just be compiled to an example shown above. In fact, you can see this in the wild with the [`partial_application` crate for rust](https://github.com/Emerentius/partial_application/blob/master/src/lib.rs), where it
cleverly uses a macro to create a partially applied function by generating closures. Anyways partial application is cool but it's also something that's more
ubiquitous than you might think. I hope this post helped you understand it a little better.
