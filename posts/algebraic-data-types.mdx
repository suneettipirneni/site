# Introduction

Algebraic data types are types that are often used by millions of developers every day. In fact as time goes on, more and more languages are adopting algebraic data types as a core feature. There's no better time than
the present to learn about them.

# A Soft Introduction to Type Theory

Type theory is simply a formal way of defining types. You can think of it to be similar to runtime analysis, but for types.

<InfoBlock kind="info" title="Notation">
  The next few sections will use a bit of set notation. Here's a quick refresher on the basics:

- $\in$ means "is an element of". For example, $1 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ holds.
- $\subseteq$ means "is a subset of". For example, $\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$ holds.
- $| |$ means "cardinality of" it counts the size of lenght of the set. For example, $|\{1, 2, 3\}| = 3$.
- $\times$ means "cartesian product of". For example:
  $$
  \{1, 2\} \times \{3, 4\} = \{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)\}
  $$
- $\notin$ means "is not an element of" it is the opposite of $\in$. For example, $1 \notin \{2, 3\}$ holds.

</InfoBlock>

I first want to show you that a type can be expressed as a set of all it's possible values. For example, the type `boolean` can be represented like so:

<Figure caption="The set of all possible values the boolean type can take on.">
$$
\text{boolean} = \{\text{true}, \text{false}\}
$$
</Figure>

A char could be represented as (assuming it's a-z):

<Figure caption="The set of all possible types a char can take on.">
$$
\text{char} = \{\text{'a'}, \text{'b'}, \text{'c'}, \dots, \text{'z'}\}
$$
</Figure>

Again, because a char can only be one of the letters in the alphabet from a-z.

This representation is useful because it gives us a structured way to model types. For example, if we ask ourselves,
"is `true` assignable to `boolean`? We simply see if $\text{true} \in \text{boolean}$ holds. On the contrary, if we ask ourselves,
"is `1` assignable to `boolean`? We can see that $\text{1} \notin \text{boolean}$ holds. Neat!

## Sum Types

Things with algebraic data types get interesting when we start to apply operations to them. Let's start with a simple example.

Given an enum:

```java
enum Color {
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE
}
```

We can represent the type `Color` as:

$$
\text{Color} = \{\text{RED}, \text{GREEN}, \text{BLUE}\}
$$

As `Color` can only be `RED`, `GREEN`, or `BLUE`. Note how it can't be two of these at the same time.

Let's count the number of possible values for `Color`. We can do this by counting the number of elements in the set:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\text{Color}| &= |\{\text{RED}, \text{GREEN}, \text{BLUE}\}| \\
             &= 3
\end{aligned}
$$

If we add another color to `Color`, say `YELLOW`, then the set of all possible values for `Color` would be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\text{Color}| &= |\{\text{RED}, \text{GREEN}, \text{BLUE}, \text{YELLOW}\}| \\
               &= 4
\end{aligned}
$$

By now, you should see a very clear pattern, the number of possible types for `Color` is the number of enum variants it has.

In other words, if we take the sum of the number of variants in an enum, we get the number of possible types for that enum. Because of this, enums are known as **sum types**.

In fact `boolean`s are sum types too! Recall $|\text{boolean}| = 2$, and there are two variants for `boolean`, `true` and `false`. therefore `boolean` is a sum type.

### Properties of Sum Types

Sum types exhibit certain properties that make them useful for developers. Let's go over them.

#### Exhaustiveness

Sum types are exhaustive, this both the developer and compiler able to make sure all variants are handled.

For example, if we implement `toString` for `Color` like so:

```java
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return switch (this) {
      case RED -> "Red";
      case GREEN -> "Green";
      case BLUE -> "Blue";
    };
  }
```

We can be sure that all variants of `Color` are handled. If we add a new variant to `Color`, say `YELLOW`,
the compiler will complain that `YELLOW` is not handled in the switch statement:

```java
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return switch (this) { // Compiler error: Switch case YELLOW not handled
      case RED -> "Red";
      case GREEN -> "Green";
      case BLUE -> "Blue";
    };
  }
```

This makes our code much safer and forces us to handle all variants.

<InfoBlock kind="info" title="Is that Java switch syntax new?">
	Yes, it's a new feature in Java 14. It's called [Switch
	Expressions](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361).
</InfoBlock>

#### Uniqueness

Each constituent of a sum type is unique. For example, `Colors.RED` is not `Colors.GREEN`, and `Colors.GREEN` is not `Colors.BLUE`. Additionally, `Colors` cannot take
on multiple variants at the same time. It cannot be `Colors.RED` and `Colors.GREEN` at the same time. Because of this we say that sum types are **disjoint**.

## Product Types

So far we've only looked a types that take on one value at a time. Let's look at a type that can take on multiple values at the same time.

Here's a more complex type, a tuple record with two fields:

```java
record Container(bool foo, bool baz) {}
```

Unlike the sum types we've seen so far, `Container` can be multiple types at the same time. It can be `foo=true, bar=true`, `foo=true, bar=false`, `foo=false, bar=true`, or `foo=false, bar=false`.

What's the set of all possible types for `Container`? Well, we can represent it as:

$$
\text{Container} = \{(\text{true, true}), (\text{true, false}), (\text{false, true}), (\text{false, false})\}
$$

Notice something interesting? The set of all possible values for `Container` is the cartesian product of the set of all possible values for `boolean` with itself.

We could also represent `Container` as a product of two `boolean`s:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Container} &= \text{boolean} \times \text{boolean} \\
                 &= \{\text{true}, \text{false}\} \times \{\text{true}, \text{false}\} \\
                 &= \{(\text{true, true}), (\text{true, false}), (\text{false, true}), (\text{false, false})\}
\end{aligned}
$$

By this, we can assume that if another field `boolean baz` was added to `Container` (`Containter(bool, bool, bool)`), the set of all possible values for `Container` would be $\text{boolean} \times \text{boolean} \times \text{boolean}$.

`Container` is known as a **product type** for this specific reason, the set of types it represents is the _product_ of the types it's composed of.

However, if we want to be more specific we can say that `Container` is a **product of sum types**. This is because `boolean` is a sum type, and `Container` is a product of `boolean`s.

### Properties of Product Types

#### Composability

Product types are composable. This means that we can compose product types to create even more complex types.

If we create refer back to the `Color` example, we can compose `Color` with `Container` to create a new type `ColorContainer`:

```java
record ColorContainer(Color color, Container container) {}
```

We can represent the set of all possible values for `ColorContainer` as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{ColorContainer} &= \text{Color} \times \text{Container} \\
                      &= \{\text{RED}, \text{GREEN}, \text{BLUE}\} \times \{(\text{true, true}), (\text{true, false}), (\text{false, true}), (\text{false, false})\} \\
                      &= \{(\text{RED, true, true}), (\text{RED, true, false}), (\text{RED, false, true}), (\text{RED, false, false}), \\
                      &\quad (\text{GREEN, true, true}), (\text{GREEN, true, false}), (\text{GREEN, false, true}), (\text{GREEN, false, false}), \\
                      &\quad (\text{BLUE, true, true}), (\text{BLUE, true, false}), (\text{BLUE, false, true}), (\text{BLUE, false, false})\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Pretty complex set of possible values right? While this may be unneccearily complex, it's helps us understand even in the most complex cases, product types are still composable.

# The problem with open types

An **open**[^1] type can be thought of as a type that can be extended or implemented by any data structure. For example, in Java, class can implement the `Iterator<T>` interface.

Consider a Java interface defined like so:

```java title="Animal.java"
interface Animal {
  String name();
  int age();
  String sound();
}
```

We'll then add some variants:

```java title="Dog.java"
record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Dog(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Woof");
  }

  public void walk() {
    System.out.println("Walking " + this.name());
  }
}

record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Cat(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Meow");
  }

  public void cleanLitterBox() {
    System.out.println("Cleaning litter box for " + this.name());
  }
}

record Cow(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Rhino(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Moo");
  }
}
```

I now have a new requirement I want to model `Animal`s that can be house pets. So now I'll introduce a new interface:

```java title="HousePet.java"
interface HousePet extends Animal {
  default void takeCareOf() {
    System.out.println("Taking care of " + this.name());
  }
}
```

I'll then make sure `Dog` and `Cat` implement `HousePet`:

```diff title="Dog.java"
- record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal
+ record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet
- record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal
+ record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet
```

This is great! I can now use a constraint to handle cases specifically for `HousePet`s:

```java
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (Animal animal : animals) {
    animal.takeCareOf();
  }
}
```

I also need to handle specific tasks for each kind of `HousePet`, so I do this:

```java
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (Animal animal : animals) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
      ((Dog) animal).walk();
    } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
      ((Cat) animal).cleanLitterBox();
    }

    throw new Exception("Not sure how to handle " + animal);
  }
}
```

I've just realized that I can't exhaustively handle all the cases for `HousePet` since it's always open to be implemented. So instead I throw an error.
This works great! I _know_ the only two cases that are `HousePet`s are `Dog` and `Cat`, so I shouldn't have to worry about the exception being thrown, right?

# A wrench thrown into the works

Well, a user of my library decides to implement `HousePet` for their own `Animal` variant:

```java title="Snake.java"
record Snake(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet {
  public Snake(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Hiss");
  }

  public void shedSkin() {
    System.out.println("Shedding skin for " + this.name());
  }
}
```

When they call `takeCareOfHousePets` they get an exception thrown. This is because I didn't handle the case for `Snake` in my `takeCareOfHousePets` method.

```java
// Exception: Not sure how to handle Snake[name=Sneaky, age=1, sound=Hiss]
takeCareOfHousePets(new List<>(new Dog("Fido", 3), new Cat("Garfield", 5), new Snake("Sneaky", 1)));
```

My code wasn't designed for people to add their own variants. However, due to the nature of access-control and interfaces, they can.

Many jaded java developers would simply accept throwing an exception as a valid solution to this problem. However, exception throwing is a last resort. It's a
hack to get around the fact that you can't exhaustively match on a product type. A more elegant solution could be validate this kind of error at compile-time.

This is where sum types come to the rescue.

# Sum types to the rescue

In earlier versions of java the concept of a sum type was essentially using an enum with an associated value:

We would remodel our code above to this:

```java title="HousePet.java"
public enum HousePet {
  DOG(new Dog()),
  CAT(new Cat()),

  constructor (Animal animal) {
    this.animal = animal;
  }
}
```

Let's look at how we can handle this sum type:

```java
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (HousePet animalVariant : animals) {
    switch (animal) {
      case DOG -> animalVariant.animal.walk();
      case CAT -> animalVariant.animal.cleanLitterBox();
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that we don't need a `default` case in our switch statement. This is because we've exhaustively matched on all the variants of `HousePet`. This is core benefit
of sum types. We can be sure that we've handled all the cases. The type cannot contain any extra variants beyond the ones we've defined.

# Modern Java makes sum types easier

You may have noticed that the enum approach introduces an unwanted level of indirection. Modern versions of java introduce the concept
of sealed types. This allows us to define our sum type like so:

```java title="HousePet.java"
public sealed interface HousePet extends Animal permits Dog, Cat {
  default void takeCareOf() {
    System.out.println("Taking care of " + this.name());
  }
}
```

This is a lot cleaner than the enum approach. We can now define our variants like we originally did:

```java
public final record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet { ... }
public final record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet { ... }
```

Let's say our user decides to implement `HousePet` for their own `Animal` variant:

```java title="Snake.java"
public final record Snake(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet {
  ...
}

// Error: Cannot implement `HousePet`, `Snake` is not a permitted type
```

The type is now closed for extension and we get a nice compile-time error.

We can guarantee that we've handled all the cases for sealed classes like `HousePet` by pattern matching `instanceof`:

```java
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (HousePet animal : animals) {
    switch (animal) {
      case Dog dog -> dog.walk();
      case Cat cat -> cat.cleanLitterBox();
    }
  }
}
```

# Other languages

The world of programming is made up of more than just java. Other languages have their own ways of handling sum types. Let's look at a few of them.

#### Rust

Rust takes a similar approach to java with the concept of enums and associated values:

```rust
enum HousePet {
  Dog(Dog),
  Cat(Cat),
}
```

Unlike Java, rust enum members can hold types that aren't covariant to other enum members. This means theoretically would could have a `Person(Person)` variant in the `HousePet` struct, even though a `Person` isn't compatible to a `HousePet`.
This behaviour allows rust enums to be more flexible than java enums in some instances.

#### Haskell

In terms of syntax, Haskell takes a different approach to sum types. It uses the `|` (union) operator to define variants:

```haskell
data HousePet = Dog Dog | Cat Cat
```

Similar to rust, each variant can be disjoint from the others.

#### Typescript

Typescript is similiar to haskell syntax-wise but uses types as-is rather than wrapping them in distinct named variants:

```typescript
type HousePet = Dog | Cat;
```

Because sum types in typescript don't have nominal labels, you can't match on them directly like you do in haskell or rust. Instead you need to use `instanceof` checks
against the types:

```typescript
function takeCareOfHousePets(animals: HousePet[]) {
	for (const animal of animals) {
		if (animal instanceof Dog) {
			animal.walk();
		} else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
			animal.cleanLitterBox();
		}
	}
}
```

However, this doesn't cover cases where objects are used instead of classes. We can't check `instanceof` on objects. So we need to use a different approach. We can use
something called a "discriminant property" to identify the type of the object. This is a property that is unique to each variant. For example, we could add a `type` to each variant:

```typescript
type Dog = {
	type: "dog";
	name: string;
	age: number;
	sound: string;
};

type Cat = {
	type: "cat";
	name: string;
	age: number;
	sound: string;
};

type HousePet = Dog | Cat;
```

Now we can disambiguate `HousePet` objects by checking the `type` property:

```typescript
function takeCareOfHousePets(animals: HousePet[]) {
	for (const animal of animals) {
		if (animal.type === "dog") {
			animal.walk();
		} else if (animal.type === "cat") {
			animal.cleanLitterBox();
		}
	}
}
```

# Conclusion

I should make it clear that polymorphic types are not useless by any means. Both sum types and polymorphic types are two different ways of modeling two different types of data.

For reference:

- When you have a type that is meant to be implemented, or is used to show a contract is satisfied. Use polymorphic types to model this. For example, if you want to model shapes, you can introduce an
  interface with a `getArea()` method. This allows you introduce new shapes under the `Shape` type umbrella.
- When you have a limited set of variants that may or may not be covariant with each other. Use sum types to model this. See our `HousePet` example above.

[^1]: This is not a formal term but I'm using it as a blanket term for classes, interfaces, etc.
