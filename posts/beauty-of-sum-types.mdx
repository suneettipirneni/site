description: I love sum types, in fact I love them so much I wrote a whole blog post about them. In this post I go over why sum types are special and how they can be used to make your code safer and more robust.

# Sum Types, the most underrated types

The sum type the is best thing to come out since sliced bread. In my early days of programming my life was constricted to the domain
of open product types. Behavior was shared through inheritance and polymorphism. I never knew I wanted sum types until I had them.

# The problem with open types

Consider a Java interface defined like so:

```java title="Animal.java"
interface Animal {
  String name();
  int age();
  String sound();
}
```

We'll then add some variants:

```java title="Dog.java"
record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Dog(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Woof");
  }

  public void walk() {
    System.out.println("Walking " + this.name());
  }
}

record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Cat(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Meow");
  }

  public void cleanLitterBox() {
    System.out.println("Cleaning litter box for " + this.name());
  }
}

record Cow(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Rhino(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Moo");
  }
}
```

I now have a new requirement I want to model `Animal`s that can be house pets. So now I'll introduce a new interface:

```java title="HousePet.java"
interface HousePet extends Animal {
  default void takeCareOf() {
    System.out.println("Taking care of " + this.name());
  }
}
```

I'll then make sure `Dog` and `Cat` implement `HousePet`:

```diff title="Dog.java"
- record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal
+ record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet
- record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal
+ record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet
```

This is great! I can now use a constraint to handle cases specifically for `HousePet`s:

```java title="Animal.java"
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (Animal animal : animals) {
    animal.takeCareOf();
  }
}
```

I also need to handle specific tasks for each kind of `HousePet`, so I do this:

```java title="Animal.java"
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (Animal animal : animals) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
      ((Dog) animal).walk();
    } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
      ((Cat) animal).cleanLitterBox();
    }

    throw new Exception("Not sure how to handle " + animal);
  }
}
```

I've just realized that I can't exhaustively handle all the cases for `HousePet` since it's always open to be implemented. So instead I throw an error.
This works great! I _know_ the only two cases that are `HousePet`s are `Dog` and `Cat`, so I shouldn't have to worry about the exception being thrown, right?

# A wrench thrown into the works

Well, a user of my library decides to implement `HousePet` for their own `Animal` variant:

```java title="Snake.java"
record Snake(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet {
  public Snake(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Hiss");
  }

  public void shedSkin() {
    System.out.println("Shedding skin for " + this.name());
  }
}
```

When they call `takeCareOfHousePets` they get an exception thrown. This is because I didn't handle the case for `Snake` in my `takeCareOfHousePets` method.

```java title="Main.java"
// Exception: Not sure how to handle Snake[name=Sneaky, age=1, sound=Hiss]
takeCareOfHousePets(new List<>(new Dog("Fido", 3), new Cat("Garfield", 5), new Snake("Sneaky", 1)));
```

My code wasn't designed for people to add their own variants. However, due to the nature of access-control and interfaces, they can.

Many jaded java developers would simply accept throwing an exception as a valid solution to this problem. However exception throwing is a last resort. It's a
hack to get around the fact that you can't exhaustively match on a product type. I would be so much better if this could be validated at compiled time.

This is where sum types come to the rescue.

# Sum types to the rescue

In earlier versions of java the concept of a sum type was essentially using an enum with an associated value:

We would remodel our code above to this:

```java title="HousePet.java"
public enum HousePet {
  DOG(new Dog()),
  CAT(new Cat()),

  constructor (Animal animal) {
    this.animal = animal;
  }
}
```

So why do we call this a sum type? It's called a sum type because the type is the sum of all of its variants. In this case, the type is the sum of `Dog` and `Cat`.

Let's look at how we can handle this sum type:

```java title="Main.java"
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (HousePet animalVariant : animals) {
    switch (animal) {
      case DOG -> animalVariant.animal.walk();
      case CAT -> animalVariant.animal.cleanLitterBox();
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that we don't need a `default` case in our switch statement. This is because we've exhaustively matched on all the variants of `HousePet`. This is core benefit
of sum types. We can be sure that we've handled all the cases. The type cannot contain any extra variants beyond the ones we've defined.

# Modern Java makes sum types easier

You may have noticed that the enum approach introduces an unwanted level of indirection. Modern versions of java introduce the concept
of sealed types. This allows us to define our sum type like so:

```java title="HousePet.java"
public sealed interface HousePet extends Animal permits Dog, Cat {
  default void takeCareOf() {
    System.out.println("Taking care of " + this.name());
  }
}
```

This is a lot cleaner than the enum approach. We can now define our variants like we originally did:

```java
public final record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet { ... }
public final record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet { ... }
```

Let's say our user decides to implement `HousePet` for their own `Animal` variant:

```java title="Snake.java"
public final record Snake(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet {
  ...
}

// Error: Cannot implement `HousePet`, `Snake` is not a permitted type
```

The type is now closed for extension. And we can gaurantee that we've handled all the cases for `HousePet` by pattern matching `instanceof`:

```java title="Main.java"
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (HousePet animal : animals) {
    switch (animal) {
      case Dog dog -> dog.walk();
      case Cat cat -> cat.cleanLitterBox();
    }
  }
}
```

# Other languages

The world of programming is made up of more than just java. Other languages have their own ways of handling sum types. Let's look at a few of them.

#### Rust

Rust takes a similar approach to java with the concept of enums and associated values:

```rust title="housepet.rs"
enum HousePet {
  Dog(Dog),
  Cat(Cat),
}
```

Unlike Java, rust enum members can hold types that aren't covariant to other enum members. This means theoretically would could have a `Person(Person)` variant in the `HousePet` struct, even though a `Person` isn't compatible to a `HousePet`.
This behaviour allows rust enums to be more flexible than java enums in some instances.

#### Haskell

In terms of syntax, Haskell takes a different approach to sum types. It uses the `|` (union) operator to define variants:

```haskell title="HousePet.hs"
data HousePet = Dog Dog | Cat Cat
```

Similar to rust, each variant can be disjoint from the others.

#### Typescript

Typescript is similiar to haskell syntax-wise but uses types as-is rather than wrapping them in distinct named variants:

```typescript title="HousePet.ts"
type HousePet = Dog | Cat;
```

Because sum types in typescript don't have nominal labels, you can't match on them directly like you do in haskell or rust. Instead you need to use `instanceof` checks
against the types:

```typescript title="index.ts"
function takeCareOfHousePets(animals: HousePet[]) {
  for (const animal of animals) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
      animal.walk();
    } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
      animal.cleanLitterBox();
    }
  }
}
```

However, this doesn't cover cases where objects are used instead of classes. We can't check `instanceof` on objects. So we need to use a different approach. We can use
something called a "discriminant property" to identify the type of the object. This is a property that is unique to each variant. For example, we could add a `type` to each variant:

```typescript title="HousePet.ts"
type Dog = {
  type: "dog";
  name: string;
  age: number;
  sound: string;
};

type Cat = {
  type: "cat";
  name: string;
  age: number;
  sound: string;
};

type HousePet = Dog | Cat;
```

Now we can disambiguate `HousePet` objects by checking the `type` property:

```typescript
function takeCareOfHousePets(animals: HousePet[]) {
  for (const animal of animals) {
    if (animal.type === "dog") {
      animal.walk();
    } else if (animal.type === "cat") {
      animal.cleanLitterBox();
    }
  }
}
```

# Conclusion

I should make it clear that polymorphic types are not useless by any means. Both sum types and polymorphic types are two different ways of modeling two different types of data.

For reference:

When you have a type that is meant to be implemented, or is used to show a contract is satisfied. Use polymorphic types to model this. For example, if you want to model shapes, you can introduce an
interface with a `getArea()` method. This allows you introduce new shapes under the `Shape` type umbrella.

When you have a limited set of variants that may or may not be covariant with each other. Use sum types to model this. See our `HousePet` example above.
